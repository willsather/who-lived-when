# Who Lived When

This is a fun, brief project to digitize the data once collected on Reddit's `r/dataisbeautiful` [Who Lived When](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1ay3vuu/oc_who_lived_when_the_overlapping_lives_of/).
As fun as this is, I cannot take credit for the idea but I enjoy messing around with web development and figured why not 
give it a try. 

All of this data is currently stored locally `people.ts`, but it's entirely possible this grows and thus require changes.  

## Getting Started

### Development mode
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Production mode

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Your app should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
